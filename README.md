<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
This project forecasts stock prices using time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA, STL) and deep learning neural networks (LSTM, GRU).
It integrates technical indicators like EMA, MACD, RSI, and Stochastic Oscillator to enrich predictions.
Models are benchmarked with RMSE, MAE, R², and MAPE to ensure accuracy and reliability.
The solution is deployed via FastAPI, Docker, and Streamlit dashboards, enabling scalable, interactive financial insights.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>
This project addresses the problem by building a predictive model that forecasts Apple’s stock prices for the next 30 days using historical data from 2012 to 2019. By leveraging time series analysis and deep learning techniques, the model aims to uncover hidden patterns in stock trends and provide data-driven insights to support informed investment decisions.
